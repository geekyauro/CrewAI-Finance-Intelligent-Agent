# AGENTS - CrewAI multi-agent orchestration
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file builds the AGENTIC layer on top of the RAG pipeline.
#
# What you'll find here:
#   - 5 CrewAI agents: Planner, Retriever, Analysis, Portfolio, Risk
#   - The RAG functions (from rag_pipeline.py) wrapped as CrewAI Tools
#   - A Planner -> Executor workflow
#   - "Agents as tools" + tool chaining (output of agent A -> input of agent B)
#   - Simple conversational memory (just a Python list - beginner-friendly)
#
# Flow at a glance:
#
#     User Query
#         |
#     Planner Agent     (decides which agents/tools to use)
#         |
#     Retriever Agent   (calls RAG tools -> fetches context)
#         |
#     Analysis Agent    (interprets the retrieved context)
#         |
#     Portfolio Agent   (gives allocation suggestions)
#         |
#     Risk Agent        (highlights risks)
#         |
#     Final Response
